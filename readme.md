Stable Diffusion installation
SD, unlike its paid counterparts like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, is an open source neural network. This means you are free to install it on your device and use it for free.
Keep in mind that Stable Diffusion's basic interface isn't the most user-friendly. If you are installing official software, you will have to work through the command line. However, the beauty of open source is that enthusiasts create alternatives very quickly. It is also important to realize that the speed and quality of work will largely depend on your video card. If it is weak, you will hardly be able to use the neural network to its full potential. The recommended graphics card is NVidia RTX 3xxx series with at least 6 GB of video memory.  It is NVidia that is recommended because the neural network uses CUDA kernels for generation, which are available only in these graphics cards.
A GTX1050Ti will be enough, but the neural network will be very slow. Graphics cards with 8 or even 12 memory will give much more comfortable performance.
